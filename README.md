# School District Analysis

## Overview of the Analysis
The purpose of the analysis of the high schools in a school district was to get the average grades per school, grade and student. It was used to obtain the spending per student in each high school which gave the ability to see if spending had any correlation with what the average was for students who passed math and reading. Then once it was realized students in a specific grade at a certain high school were cheating, the analysis was done to see what changes this made to the results. 

### Results of the Analysis of the Grade Metrics
The results of the analysis were the overall picture did not change. Due to the small change in percentages for Thomas High School, when the averages were rounded they remained the same. The only way to see the affect was if the averages were not rounded. Part of why the picture did not change is the number of students removed was small compared to the total number of high schoolers in the district. The total number of students removed from the analysis is 461 students. The total number of students in the initial analysis was 39,170. This can be seen in the photos below.

As seen in the screen shots the only changes occurred in the medium school size data. The changes that occurred were:

- The average math score went up .01%. 
- The average reading score went up .01%.
- The average passing math score went down .017%
- The average passing reading score went down .006%
- The overall passing percentage went down .063%

What this means is when the averages were rounded they did not change making it look like nothing changed in the analysis which is shown in the photos below.

The two photos above show that the removal of the 9th grade Thomas High School student grades did not affect the school budgets or spending per student budget.
