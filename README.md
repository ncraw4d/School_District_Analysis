# School District Analysis

## Overview of the Analysis
The purpose of the analysis of the high schools in a school district was to get the average grades per school, grade and student. It was used to obtain the spending per student in each high school which gave the ability to see if spending had any correlation with what the average was for students who passed math and reading. Then once it was realized students in a specific grade at a certain high school were cheating, the analysis was done to see what changes this made to the results.
