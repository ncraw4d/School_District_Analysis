# School District Analysis

## Overview of the Analysis
The purpose of the analysis of the high schools in a school district was to get the average grades per school, grade and student. It was used to obtain the spending per student in each high school which gave the ability to see if spending had any correlation with what the average was for students who passed math and reading. Then once it was realized students in a specific grade at a certain high school were cheating, the analysis was done to see what changes this made to the results. 

### Results of the Analysis
The results of the analysis were the overall picture did not change. Due to the small change in percentages for Thomas High School, when the averages were rounded they remained the same. The only way to see the affect was if the averages were not rounded. Part of why the picture did not change is the number of students removed was small compared to the total number of high schoolers in the district. The total number of students removed from the analysis is 461 students. The total number of students in the initial analysis was 39,170. This can be seen in the two screen shots below.
