# School District Analysis

## Overview of the Analysis
The purpose of the analysis was to show the number of high school students who passed math and reading. Another goal of the analysis was to show the averages of the students who passed math and reading by grade, school, and school type in in the school district.  Finally, the analysis was used to obtain the spending per student in each high school which gave the ability to see if spending had any correlation with what the average grades were for students who passed math and reading. The analysis needed to be updated because information was given that the 9th grade students at Thomas High School were cheating. The school district wanted to see if the removal of these ninth graders' grades changed the analysis of the data.

### Results of the Analysis of the Grade Metrics
The results of the analysis were the overall picture did not change. Due to the small change in percentages for Thomas High School, when the averages were rounded they remained the same. The only way to see the affect was if the averages were not rounded. Part of why the picture did not change is the number of students removed was small compared to the total number of high schoolers in the district. The total number of students removed from the analysis was 461 students. The total number of students in the initial analysis was 39,170. This can be seen in the photos below.

As seen in the screen shots the only changes occurred in the medium school size data. The changes that occurred were:

- The average math score went up .01%. 
- The average reading score went up .01%.
- The average passing math score went down .017%
- The average passing reading score went down .006%
- The overall passing percentage went down .063%

What this means is when the averages were rounded they did not change making it look like nothing changed in the analysis which is shown in the photos below.

The two photos above show that the removal of the 9th grade Thomas High School student grades did not affect the school budgets or spending per student budget.

##### Conclusion

As discussed above four changes in the school district analysis were all small percentage changes in the math and reading scores as well as the average passing scores for math and reading.  The small number of students removed from the analysis did not lead to large, noticeable changes in the data.
